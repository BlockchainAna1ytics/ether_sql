# ether_sql
A Python library to push ethereum blockchain data into an sql database.

ether_sql was built by [Analyse Ether](https://www.analyseether.com/), with the goal of making Ethereum data easily available to everyone. This library can be used as a backbone for creating block explorers or performing data analysis. 

ether_sql is written in Python 2.7, uses [ethjsonrpc](https://github.com/analyseether/ethjsonrpc) for geting data using JSON-RPC calls and uses [SqlAlchemy](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) to connect to a postgressql database.


# Build Status
This is currently in very alpha stage, and not recommended for production use until it has received sufficient testing. 
It currently supports Parity node but will be expanded to use several nodes.

# Installation guide
1. Install the required Linux dependencies

`#installing psql`     
`sudo apt-get install postgresql`     
`#installing pyethereum dependencies`     
`sudo apt-get install libssl-dev build-essential automake pkg-config libtool libffi-dev libgmp-dev libyaml-cpp-dev`

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

`virtualenv envname`     
`envname\bin\activate`

3. Install the required python dependencies

`pip install -r requirements`


# Database setup guide


1. Create a new psql user and database

`sudo -u postgres createuser -s -P -e $USER`

This prompts for a user password, use the same password in the settings.py file

2. Create the ether_sql database in psql

`createdb ether_sql`

3. Create the tables by executing this command from the repo ether_sql  

`python ether_sql.py create_tables`
